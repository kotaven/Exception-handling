Exception handling is the process of responding to unwanted or unexpected events when a computer program runs. Exception handling deals with these events to avoid the program or system crashing, and without this process, exceptions would disrupt the normal operation of a program. Exceptions occur for numerous reasons, including invalid user input, code errors, device failure, the loss of a network connection, insufficient memory to run an application, a memory conflict with another program, a program attempting to divide by zero or a user attempting to open files that are unavailable.
